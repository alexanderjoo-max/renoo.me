        <p>Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry, with millions of patients traveling abroad each year for affordable, high-quality care. Popular procedures include:</p>

          <li><strong>Cosmetic Surgery:</strong> Botox, rhinoplasty, liposuction, breast augmentation</li>
          <li><strong>Dental Care:</strong> Implants, veneers, full smile makeovers</li>
